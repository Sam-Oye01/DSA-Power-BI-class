## DAY ONE (29 - 05 - 2025)

### Introduction to Microsoft Power BI 

Today, classes began on the use of Microsoft Power BI for analysis. One of the four power tools is Power BI. Others are : 

- Power Apps
- Power Automate
- Power Virtual agents

**Power BI (Business Intelligence)**

Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence tool that converts data from different data sources to interactive dashboards and BI reports. It is a collection of software services, apps and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, virtually immersive and interactive insights. 

The collection of software services are :

- Power BI desktop : a software application for building reports.
- Power Bi service : a software as a service (SAAS) application, it requires an enterprise account that runs on subscription. It stores reports created on the desktop in the cloud and makes it public for interaction and collaboration.
- Power BI Mobile Apps : an application which can be accessed on mobile phones. Public users can view reports on the mobile app version of Power BI. It cannot be used for building reports.

Available data sources in Power BI

- Flat files.
- SQL database.
- OData feed.
- Blank query.
- Azure cloud platform.
- Online services.
- Other data sources such as Hadoop, Exchange, or ACtive directory.

Other Business intelligence are Tableau and SSRS.

**Power BI steps for Visualization**

- Step 1 : Define questions & goals.
- Step 2 : Collect data (Data ingestion)
- Step 3 : Data wrangling (Data cleaning and transformation).
- Step 4 : Determine analysis.
- Step 5 : interpret results.

**Power BI Desktop interface**

There are four views on the Power BI desktop interface. They are :

- Report view.
- Table vieew.
- Model view.
- Dax query view.

**ETL in Power BI**

E : Extract 

T : Transform

L : Load

Before loading any data into the Power BI environment, it must first be transformed and cleaned for easy analysis. Transformation in Power BI is done in the "Power Query Editor".

The ultimate goal of transformation is to remove unwanted data that may affect interpretation of data.

**Power Query Editor**

The power query editor can be accessed on the "home" tab under the "query" group. Every applied steps is seen on the query settings pane at the far right of the power query editor.

Data preview options on the "View" tab power query editor helps to ascertain certain properties about the Data. The data preview options are :

- Column quality : Helps to check valid data and percentage error.
- Column distribution : Shows the distinct data entities in our column. The distribution of the data based on the information given.
- Column profile : Shows the statistics of an entire column. 

**Note** : Tableau can connect much larger datasets as compared to Power BI which only has a limit of 1 Gb data in free version. You can use the preview features in the options and settings to edit the architecture of the Power BI interface. Reports are built on the "Canvas" in the report view.

## DAY TWO (02 - 06 - 2025)

### Power Query Editor for Data transformation (ETL) I

Today, we delved fully into transformation of data in the power query editor. We carried out the following operations. 

- Changing of Data Types.
- Transposing of tables.
- Use of filled down.
- Use of promoted headers.
- Renaming of columns.
- Use of Pivot and Unpivot columns.
- Replace values.

**Note** : All of these operations are done through the transform tab. 

**How to manually create tables and enter data**

Power Bi can also be used to create tables instead of importing tables using the "Enter data" option in the home tab.

## DAY THREE (04 - 06 -2025)

### Power Query Editor for Data Transformation (ETL) II

**Note** : There is no way to have a clean analysis without Data cleaning.
